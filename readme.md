# Itch

I use a Colemak keyboard layout and on many systems I need to log in with a password and will need to switch to a Qwerty layout for password input. 

# Scratch

Make this single page app that generates common keys between the two layouts so I don't need to think too hard. This is probably a really bad idea and I suggest no one ever use it...

The passwords generated have some structure in them in that letters, numbers and symbols are grouped in small bunches. When a key requires shift being pressed, the next key will not require switching hands and pressing the other shift key. Keys on the far edges of the keyboard which are hard to reach keeping on the home row are optional.

# Using

- Laraval to do the routing and to serve as a one endpoint API
- VueJS to handle the frontend UI and make requests from the API
